# Memory Game Project

This is the finished version of [this](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) Udacity Front End Nanodegree project. It is mostly a JavaScript exercise. Check out the live version [here](https://front-ant.github.io/memory-game/).

The task was to create a memory game with timer function, counter and rating system. Also, the basic game logic had to be implemented.

## Future Improvements

+ Add responsiveness features
+ Fix Microsoft Edge/IE compatability issues
